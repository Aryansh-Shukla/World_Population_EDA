# 🌍 World Population EDA

This project presents an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the **world population dataset**, spanning from 1970 to 2022. The aim is to uncover global and continental population trends, analyze distributions, and identify interesting patterns using visualizations and descriptive statistics.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- **File**: `world_population.csv`
- **Content**: Population data of countries from 1970 to 2022
- **Columns Include**:
  - Country
  - Continent
  - Population for years: 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2015, 2020, and 2022

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Seaborn** & **Matplotlib** for data visualization

---

## 🔍 Key Steps in the Analysis

- **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values, unique counts, and data types.
- **Sorting & Grouping**: Ranked countries and continents by population.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarized key numerical trends across years.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Explored relationships between year-wise populations.
- **Continental Trends**: Aggregated population data by continent to identify growth patterns.
- **Visualization**:
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Line plots for population growth per continent
  - Boxplots to detect outliers and distribution skew

---

## 📊 Insights & Observations

- **Asia** consistently leads in population size across all decades.
- **Oceania** has the lowest average population but steady growth.
- The **global population has grown significantly** from 1970 to 2022 across all continents.
- **Boxplots revealed** the presence of population outliers, with some countries far exceeding others in size.
- Strong positive **correlations** exist between populations across years, indicating a stable growth trend.

## 📷 Visual Highlights

- 🔥 **Correlation Heatmap**: Highlights how populations over different years are strongly correlated.
- 🌎 **Line Chart**: Shows average population trends per continent from 1970–2022.
- 📦 **Boxplot**: Displays population spread and highlights high-population outliers.
